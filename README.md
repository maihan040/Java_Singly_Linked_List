# Java_Singly_Linked_List

## Purpose:

This is an implementation of a singly linked list written in Javathon. Goal of this project is to build a library of methods that each can  
interact with the linked list object to perform the desired operation, as well as explain via detalied comments how each method works.

## Motivation:

Motivation for this project was twofold: 
  
  * Learn to become proficient with git/github
  * Provide a resource of Java tied together with popular Computer Science concepts

## Tech/framework used:

  * openjdk version "11.0.10"
 
## Features:

  Code will have heavy documentation throughout, which serves to clearly show the operation of each method.
  Relevant sections are clearly marked, to make it easer for readers to understand the flow of the overall design

## Contents:
  
  * Node.java: class file for implementing a singly linked list node that will be used to build the list
  * Linked_List.java: module consisting of the many possible operations that can be applied to a singly linked list
  * Linked_List_Driver.java: module which will create an instance of the "Linked_List" class and test the various methods
  * .gitignore: git ingore file with list of files that won't be included
